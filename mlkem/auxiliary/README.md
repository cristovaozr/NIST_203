# Auxiliary functions

This folder contains code for the auxiliary functions as defined on the FIPS.203
specification, chapter 4.

As of August 23rd, 2024 these functions are implemented using Python's
cryptographic API. Probably in the near future I shall implement these functions
myself as an exercise, and also to make this library self-contained.
